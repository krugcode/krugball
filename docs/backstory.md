The antipope sits in Avignon.
Fields of wine, fields of war.
Tax men rolling plague soaked kin,
scrying for a lonely coin.
A blood-soaked dispute of Salic Law.

"The conjunction of the spheres!"
The councillor's fear shook mountains
"The last of our days approach, sire!"

All wize men, evil amongst, answer the Emperor's call
bring peace to the fields, bring life to the people
bring meaning to the apocalypse.

"A ritual of blood" said the heretic.
"A duel of honour" said the monk.
The small voice echoed through eternity,
"Why not both?"
